Since I've just about mastered Python and Data Engineering systems within Python, I figured it would be good to idea to get experience and exposure to full-stack web development starting with the basics of HTML and CSS.  I will then focus on improving my current knowledge of Flask and picking up a bit of Javascript for future references and tinkering with things like React.

Please feel free to dev with me and submit PR so we can learn together.
